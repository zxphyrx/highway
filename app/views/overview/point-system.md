# The point system

Points are the currency of Highway! Here's everything you need to know about them.

As always, if you have any questions, ask in #highway-help!

## Overview

Points are awarded when you either:
- Attend an event that gives you 1 point
- Get a design approved
    - Starter projects: 4 points
    - Custom projects: 6/10 points.

By default, custom projects give you 6 points, but if its a particularly complicated project (i.e 3D printer), you can get 10 points out of it.

To get 10 points, you MUST get confirmation on your idea BEFORE working on it first. DM @alexren on the slack to check with them first
