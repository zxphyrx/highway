# Undercity

**Undercity** is a 4 day hardware hackathon hosted at GitHub HQ in San Francisco, California, USA from July 11-14th.

To qualify for Undercity, you need at least 4 points! Don't worry if shipping dates are slow, you don't need a physically built project until August 7th

## What's a hackathon?

A social making marathon! Team up with other teenagers around the world and try to make the goofiest, coolest project in 72 hours - from start to finish. At the end, you'll demo your project to others, and there will be prizes! 

Throughout the hackathon, there'll be plenty of activities and workshops you can go to. Ever want to compete in a macropad speedrun or play smash with custom characters at 2am? There will be tons of things you can do here!

All meals (from dinner on Friday, to breakfast on Monday) will be provided during Undercity. You'll stay in GitHub HQ for the duration of the event - bring a sleeping bag!
