# Parent's Guide to Highway to Undercity

## What is Hack Club?

**Hack Club is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, whose mission is to foster a generation of coders, makers, builders, and founders. Hack Club's online community has a network of more than 50,000 high school students from around the world.**

Hack Club programs are free and accessible to all students. Highway to Undercity is a Hack Club program, where students are encouraged and funded to create real hardware projects.

Hack Club is supported by many notable figures in the tech industry, including GitHub founder Tom Preston-werner, Dell Founder Michael Dell, as well as executives at Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and GitHub.

#### What is Highway?

Highway is a hardware electronics grant program where we give out grants to teenagers to build hardware projects! From now until July 31, your child can make as many hardware projects as they want - and we'll fund up to 350 USD per project.

#### What is Undercity?

Undercity is a 4-day, in-person hardware electronics event for high school students at GitHub HQ! Your child will get together with other teens from all over the world to try to make an electronics project in under 72 hours.

**Undercity is invite-only**; in order to recieve an invitation, your child will need to get to 12 points through Highway. You earn points through making projects!

#### What are the costs associated?

Participation is entirely free! Meals and activities during Undercity are covered. Participants are generally responsible for their own travel to San Francisco, although we do offer travel stipends.

## Safety

Hack Club is committed to creating a safe and comfortable environment for students at our events. During the event, a toll-free staff helpline (+1 855-625-HACK) will be available 24/7 for you to contact us if needed.

#### On security

There will be security guards 24/7 around the venue from both Hack Club and GitHub. Your child will not be able to leave the venue unless they have a freedom wavier signed.

Staff will be present at all times to supervise. Everyone who enters the venue will be ID checked.

This is a safe space for all students. We aim for a gender-balanced community, and there will be gender-separated spaces for participants to sleep in at the event.

#### Participants should bring:

- ID (needs to be government issued; for check-in)
- Laptop (and charger)
- Water bottle
- Any hardware they want to use (although we will have tons provided at Undercity)
- Their hardware project from Highway to showcase it to others! (if possible)
- Clothes for 3 nights
- Toiletries - toothbrush, toothpaste, any hygiene products

## Travel

When your child reaches 8 points, we will send them a Travel Form to fill out. 

#### Visa information

If your child is traveling internationally, they may need either an [ESTA](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/esta) or a visa based on their country of citizenship. Meeting the requirements to enter the United States is the responsibility of the attendee, and you are encouraged to do your own research.

If you require a Letter of Invitation from Hack Club, your child can let us know in the Travel Form.

Visa expenses will not be paid by Hack Club under any circumstances.

#### Travel Stipends

We are giving out limited travel stipends; see the [Undercity](undercity) page for details.

Your child will be reimbursed the travel stipend amount *after* they reach 12 points and finish their projects.

Travelling by car, bus, or train? The [Hack Club Gas Fund](https://gas.hackclub.com/) can reimburse your costs! However, you'll still need an invite to come.
