# Sourcing parts

Welcome to part sourcing! Here's a ton of tips for you to optimize the cost of your part



If you're ever unsure of your BOM, send it in #highway! People can definitely help you pick bigger parts.

## Specific parts

### Modules (TP4056, LED matrices, etc)

Almost always the cheapest option is to get it from AliExpress; the only downside is that shipping *may* take awhile

If you're in a pinch, Amazon actually has OK prices all things considered.

### SBCs (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, etc)
Raspberry Pi
You can get Orange Pis from aliexpress.

Depending on your application though, you can also repurpose old laptops/desktops for your specific application if it's not space-sensitive

### Microcontrollers (arduino, RP2040, etc)
AliExpress is still usually your go-to for this! 

Arduinos are fairly outdated by todays standards

### PCBs

- If you're in India, use SEEED. They take HCB cards and are by far the cheapest option
- If you're from another country, use JLCPCB, they offer pcbs for under $6 shipped as long as its under 100x100mm
- If you're from the US specifically, use PCBWAY. They're roughly half the cost of JLCPCB because they're able to avoid tarrifs some how

### Batteries (Li-Po, CR2032, AA, etc)

## Specific countries

### India:
- Most vendors do not take int'l cards, which unfortunately HCB falls into the category of. Contact your local vendors to try to get that changed!

## Tips for specific vendors

### AliExpress
aliexpress is one of the highest skill ceiling stores out there - there's a ton of optimization you can do. Here's some tips:

- The welcome deal only works once when you make your account, so don't budget off of that - you will be hit by significantly higehr prices afterwards.
- Pay attention to the estimate shipment date. This will vary by region, but generally speaking it's actually fairly reliable
- Also pay attention to the shipping cost! Usually items that don't have free shipping but a lower initial price actually end up being more expensive when you tally the costs
- There's specific vendors that are useful:
    - AITXEM ROBOT
    - Triangleab
